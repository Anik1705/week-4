4.	Why does this code not calculate the average?
print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
# It does not calculate the average because there is no parenthesis between 3+4+5/3. 
Python first divide 5 by 3 then add 3 and 4. It should be : ((3+4+5)/5) for the average  

5.	Consider the following code:
x = 19.93
y = 20.00
z = y – x
print(z)
The output is 0.0700000000028    Why is that so?   
Improve the code so that the output is to two decimal places.

# pyhton return the complet result of the substraction , if we want the result in 2 decimal places we have to format 
the output : 
y = 20.00
x = 19.93
z = y - x
print ("%.2f" % z)

6.	Find at least three compile-time errors:
int x = 2
Print (x, squared is, x * x)
xcubed = x *** 3

# the "int" before the x
  inside print must be inside quotation mark
  xcubed = x ** 3
  
right code : 
x = 2
print ("x squared is", x*x)
xcubed = x**3
print (xcubed)

7.	Find two run-time errors:
from math import sqrt
X = 2
Y = 4
print(“The product of “, x, “and”, y, “is”, x + y)
print(“The root of their difference is “, sqrt(x – y))

# X – Y is negative there can’t be the squad of a negative value
The product is not x + y but x * y
