1.	Explain the mistake in the following code:
radius = input("Radius:")
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi * radius ** 2

#we have to put "int" before "input(Radius")
the right code  is :

radius = int(input("Radius:"))
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi * radius ** 2
print  (int(area))

2.	Explain the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3(x + y)


3.	Explain the mistake in the following code:
radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
 
#float shoud be before inpuut like:
radius = float(input("Enter the radius:"))
print(float(radius))
